Create a single HTML file for me called keyboard.html that:
- shows a tray of all 26 letters
- shows an empty keyboard grid
- lets me drag letters from the tray into the grid slots  
Do not use React, npm or any build tools.  
Write everything (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in one file so I can just save it and open it in my browser.  
Explain where I should paste the code and how to run it.
